opinion,,,,,,,,
Highly not recommended. ,,,,,,,,
I would very much prefer going to school physically at least there i can concentrate unline online where I'm literally in bed during class ,,,,,,,,
It has its share of advantages and disadvantages but it has a better advantage over traditional ,,,,,,,,
"I personally enjoy online learning for the most part. However, there are more distractions than in a physical class and it's a bit difficult to concentrate. ",,,,,,,,
"If is not effective at all in acquiring knowledge especially a science based course being very practical. The workload is also ridiculous because apparently because were home we have nothing to do?? Itâ€™s been challenging physically, mentally and emotionally and at the end of the semester I have honestly not gained any content from my online classes ",,,,,,,,
"Some people are doing really well in this online thing but personally it is just not motivating and even though I hated school, face to face got me working. ",,,,,,,,
More convenient but less effective and not very equal playing field for the disadvantaged ,,,,,,,,
