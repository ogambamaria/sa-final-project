Technical University of Kenya,It's not that much effective compared to face to face learning. ,,,,,,,
Daystar,It's harder to concentrate compared to physical classes but is convenient for general life,,,,,,,
Daystar university ,"It makes more sense to do exams online where you can refer because that's how our courses will be applied in real life. However, it's pretty hard focusing on learning when its online",,,,,,,
Catholic university of eastern Africa ,"It has been quite difficult,  teachers aren't as thorough as they used to be and we are given loads of assignments and in our school the teacher works with his own timing instead of the one that is given I.e cats on Sunday ",,,,,,,
Kenyatta University ,It wasn't as effective due to communication setbacks brought about by technology and also there is less interaction hence learning isn't as effective ,,,,,,,
African Nazarene University ,Itâ€™s pretty good in line with the free time,,,,,,,
Kenya School of Law ,"To be honest, the school has done really well with teaching daily online classes. 
Some lecturers are just unable to use technology. ",,,,,,,
Mount Kenya University,"I don't think it's very efficient considering many students experience network issues and some lecturers aren't well versed with the systems put in place.
It's a challenge as compared to face to face learning and I believe that as soon as it's safe to resume the latter schools should do so.",,,,,,,
Pioneer International University,I found it sort of convenient in respect to like attendance and also how the classes can be recorded for review later but I find that it is much easier to skip classes and still get marked present and very easy to cheat on cats and exams which defeats the whole purpose of assessment. Overall I feel you need very high self control to consistently keep up with classes and also be privileged enough to access to things like computers and the good internet.,,,,,,,
Daystar University,"Challenges, internet connectivity and prolonged hours of sitting without a break. Work load is more intense, shorter deadlines.
Benefits. Listening to recorded classes for reference.
Has it been effective not as much. Probably taught myself 80% of the units.",,,,,,,
,They didn't care that people come from different backgrounds and that not everyone might afford a laptop or phone .They never catered for bundles to be online. its a public university not everyone had amenities to facility online learning.,,,,,,,
KCA,Scam. Don't endorse it,,,,,,,
Kenyatta University,Its quite effective for people with internet connectivity but a huga disadvantage to those without.We are in the fourth week of learning but there are some people who have never attended classes almost half of the expected population,,,,,,,
KCA UNIVERSITY ,Online Learning is trash. I don't like it and I'd rather go to school physically. ,,,,,,,
Technical University of Mombasa,Really prefer the traditional methods to online classes. My concentration on online classes is really very limited,,,,,,,
Kenyatta university,I think it's better than traditional in acquisition of knowledge. However it's faced by many difficulties and the attitude of students to try it out since it's a new concept to most of the students,,,,,,,
Karatina University ,on a scale of 1-10 its -1,,,,,,,
Kabarak University ,Online learning is worse than the traditional methods of learning since interaction with the lecturer and the students is minimal. Practical sessions are hard since you cannot actively engage in them.,,,,,,,
