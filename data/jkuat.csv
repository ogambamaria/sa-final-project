Hate it. Lecturers aren’t equipped for such teaching ,,,,,,,,
"I love it! I can be able to have my classes anywhere! 
For me, getting to my school was terrible. I live in Kileleshwa And my school is all the way in Juja. It would take me at most an hour to get there... and going back home was way worrsee. 
With online classes I’m saving a lot of time, so I can work and still have my classes. 

Although, I’d love to access the library in my school for research purposes. But the good thing is that almost every book in that library can be accessed online. 

Online classes are everything! 

Also, I’m not trying to catch COVID-19. ",,,,,,,,
It is very ineffective especially when doing math units which require special attention,,,,,,,,
It is not efficient,,,,,,,,
"It's shitty,that's traditional methods seem to be better but that should be that way,our systems are just lagging.",,,,,,,,
I prefer online learning honestly cause my concentration is better. And also I’m a terrible time keeper so it helps cause when i wake up i just log in,,,,,,,,
