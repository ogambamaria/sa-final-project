"It isn't as effective as traditional learning and a lot of things I'm supposed to learn are better off done in practice . The benefits of this is that I don't have to get ready for school and I can always watch any missed lectures that I didn't attend. Challenges of course outweigh the benefits... Internet connection of involved parties is sometimes awful, so much time is spent preparing for the class, the huge number of students in the zoom doesn't permit adequate questioning of the particular topic and it just doesn't feel like learning to me!",,,,,,,,
"It's convenient because you don't have to physically go anywhere to learn but with extreme distractions,, lol it's basically background noise",,,,,,,,
Online learning is barely effective as students are deprived of the very vital interaction between each other that enhances learning ,,,,,,,,
"Tbh, trash trash. In class, you are able to place your full attention unlike from home. It does not also consider 3 part influences on my ability to attend the class. If there is no electricity, there is probably no internet and accessing that class will be a nightmare. In class, lecturer is able to give a question and ask you to solve it, then it becomes an easy way to query where you didn't understand from classmates or the lecturer. Discussions are also difficult with online schooling.",,,,,,,,
"It's definitely harder. Paying attention is more difficult, the assignments are heavier and quite time consuming, and staring at screens all day causes headaches. However, even with traditional methods of teaching it was still tiring but in a different way. The challenges were poor internet connection and power outages which would render some unable to attend classes. The benefits include learning from home so you're comfortable and you don't have to think about commuting. In terms of acquiring knowledge I feel like there's no difference. We still have to read a lot on our own. ",,,,,,,,
easy to get distracted and the classes are shorter. acquiring knowledge is the same. ,,,,,,,,
"Less effective
Poor connection 
Power outage
Bundles cost",,,,,,,,
"First of all, theres too much work, they dont take into consideration that we're in the middle of a whole pandemic. Second, University of Nairobi is quite unfair especially considering its vast majority consists of people who can not access online classes yet they still choose to push for it and exclude very many people.",,,,,,,,
"It's stressful and expensive, however, it has proved to be necessary during these trying times",,,,,,,,
It's been really hectic especially studying chemistry online with little to no visual aids and no experiments. The work load is thrice the normal workload when we are in school physically. Lectures seem to really rash through topics and it's really anxiety fuelling to ask questions in a meeting if you didn't understand. My experience hasn't been great but the only thing i love about online learning is that  the flexibility of hours and that I can attend without thinking about my physical appearance ,,,,,,,,
"It's really exhausting to have to look at a screen from 8-5
The teachers try to provide learning materials 
Communication barrier is the biggest issue because sometimes we have a week long blackout and the network isn't as good so you miss a week's worth of class 
Or the lec does not know how to use the platform so he or she is just unclear all through
Mathematics classes are the worst because you literally don't understand and the lec just moves on without you ",,,,,,,,
It is not as efficient as physical classes as sometimes I just decide to sleep.,,,,,,,,
"Has it benefits as well as its losses, but losses are much more.
I prefer traditional methods of teaching as there is more teacher student contact time.
Aquisition of knowledge is not at the level one would like to be at.",,,,,,,,
"Online learning has honestly been difficult. Not only due to the change of environment, but also the ignorance of some lectures to the facts. Teaching is rushed, and it is difficult to follow concepts when you donâ€™t have enough time to internalise what is happening. I could go on, but to summarise, it is hard ",,,,,,,,
"It's like when you're watching a video on YouTube, then get distracted by another tab. It lacks the human touch of a classroom, both in the lecturer/student and student/students (with classmates or schoolmates)relationships...group work, has to be done online too. 
Living in a noisy neighbourhood, is crazy, for home study and also while attending the classes.
It is flexible, alright, in the sense that you don't even have to actively participate(most of the time the audio and video broadcasting from the students' devices is disabled), and in the event that one misses a session, they can get a recorded version of it. Saves on time too, that would have otherwise been lost trying to manoeuvre through traffic, if one doesn't reside within the school.

It is poor on our end. Using google meet that only accommodates 100 students yet my class has 180 peopl- royal rumble every day. There's the problem of a online poor library even the lexis nexis subscription the school didn't renew. I honestly believe no professional body should endorse these degrees. Then the jokers at CLE decided no other online exam should be offered but the online classes should continue as they are. Smh! Is evaluation better than learning the course?,,,,,,,,
"It has been not been as good as it is put out to be in public. Starting from the quality of connection on the lecturer's side to the complete inconsistency of hosting of classes as per the timetables. In terms of the extent to which we, as students, grasp information that is being taught, I would say we are able to retain close to nothing from it. Perhaps, it might be my school alone in the entire university, but the experience of online learning was horrible for me. ",,,,,,,,
"Harder to understand whatever is being taught, Internet problems, participants limits on conferencing apps. Would rather study traditionally in school",,,,,,,,
My academic life has definitely taken a hit. My attention span for classes seems shorter than when I was attending face to face classes ,,,,,,,,
"Lecturers insist on using  video conferencing platforms that cannot accommodate large number of students.... it also takes them awhile to figure how the platforms work 
Some refuse to share learning materials or record classes 
It's just frustrating. The only convenience is that I'm learning from my bed . It's not very effective because quite a number of students aren't able to access classes because of lack of wifi, bundles, smart phones etc . With face to face learning at least everyone is able to come to class and learn ",,,,,,,,
"It's easier to asks questions online, it's harder to concentrate online, ultimately traditional learning is better in my opinion ",,,,,,,,
It was not very effective. Lecturers were having a hard time adjusting to the technology. It is discriminatory towards students who are unable to access the Internet. It is also biased against those who come from backgrounds which are unsuitable to learning.,,,,,,,,
"It is a remarkably inferior quality of education as compared to face in face learning and yet fees seem to not reflect that at all. Not to mention that it is more or less inaccessible to people living in far off places. During face to face learning one could seek clarification from the lecturer or with peers at convenience which made learning to be, dare I say, an enjoyable experience. This is not the case now. ",,,,,,,,
Online learning is not as effective as face to face learning. Unreliable electricity and difficulties in accessing electronics that support online learning are just afew of the issues experienced.,,,,,,,,
