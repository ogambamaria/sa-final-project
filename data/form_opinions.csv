On the other hand, it has kept me on top of my assignments somehow as I tend to finish my work more on time. 
I wish that we were tested in better fashion considering this is online learning. The refusing to move forward with learning and retain traditional testing methods is a clear indicator as to why our education system is considered low as a whole, in Australia they understood that a pandemic was ongoing and instead of giving the students written tests for technical units like Engineering, they gave students tasks and graded them on those given tasks.

It is flexible, alright, in the sense that you don't even have to actively participate(most of the time the audio and video broadcasting from the students' devices is disabled), and in the event that one misses a session, they can get a recorded version of it.

I've seen my friends starting businesses and juggling school. I love this way of learning despite having to learn self control when studying and  attending classes but I've seen more growth in myself and my friends dying this online learning period.,
2/1/2021 10:55:18,Other,Technical University of Mombasa,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,Really prefer the traditional methods to online classes. My concentration on online classes is really very limited,
2/1/2021 11:19:50,Strathmore University,,"Humanities - business, law, international studies, etc.",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,I don't see much of a difference in both modes of teaching but I have had trouble concentrating in online classes as opposed to physical classes,
2/1/2021 11:32:34,Strathmore University,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,"It's less effective, far less effective if I may add on, because there isn't that interaction, student-teacher interaction, and the delivery on the various platforms is poor really as compared to the traditional way of it",
2/1/2021 11:39:55,Strathmore University,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,Online classes are difficult compared to physical classes...the workload is more and paying attention is quite difficult especially when you're at home. Acquiring knowledge?? Ok for some units the lecs are very nice so i understand as soon as I'm taught...some lectures may be a bit boring (especially mathematics classes)some lecs are slow or teach for long hrs without giving breaks...so i have to teach myself some of the concepts or rather watch the recordings. ,
2/1/2021 11:48:29,JKUAT,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",No,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,It is not efficient,
2/1/2021 12:02:05,JKUAT,,"Humanities - business, law, international studies, etc.",Yes,E-learning platforms,,"It's shitty,that's traditional methods seem to be better but that should be that way,our systems are just lagging.",
2/1/2021 13:20:16,University of Nairobi,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,"It's easier to asks questions online, it's harder to concentrate online, ultimately traditional learning is better in my opinion ",
2/1/2021 15:21:59,University of Nairobi,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,It was not very effective. Lecturers were having a hard time adjusting to the technology. It is discriminatory towards students who are unable to access the Internet. It is also biased against those who come from backgrounds which are unsuitable to learning.,
2/1/2021 15:28:34,Other,Kenyatta university,"Humanities - business, law, international studies, etc.",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,I think it's better than traditional in acquisition of knowledge. However it's faced by many difficulties and the attitude of students to try it out since it's a new concept to most of the students,
2/1/2021 16:18:18,University of Nairobi,,"Humanities - business, law, international studies, etc.",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,"It is a remarkably inferior quality of education as compared to face in face learning and yet fees seem to not reflect that at all. Not to mention that it is more or less inaccessible to people living in far off places. During face to face learning one could seek clarification from the lecturer or with peers at convenience which made learning to be, dare I say, an enjoyable experience. This is not the case now. ",
2/1/2021 16:47:31,Other,Karatina University ,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,E-learning platforms,,on a scale of 1-10 its -1,it would be better than it
2/1/2021 16:57:58,Other,Kabarak University ,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,Online learning is worse than the traditional methods of learning since interaction with the lecturer and the students is minimal. Practical sessions are hard since you cannot actively engage in them.,Face to face learning is better off than online learning 
2/1/2021 17:47:10,University of Nairobi,,"Humanities - business, law, international studies, etc.",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,Online learning is not as effective as face to face learning. Unreliable electricity and difficulties in accessing electronics that support online learning are just afew of the issues experienced.,
2/1/2021 18:14:51,Strathmore University,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,"It is actually more effective,  more efficient in terms of how lecturers deliver material, this is holding challenges such as network availability and power outages. ","Both need to compliment one another.  Interactive face to face sessions have that kind of ""inter personal element"" that makes learning more fun compared to the redundancy and zoom fatigue of online classes. "
2/1/2021 22:58:23,Strathmore University,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.",,Concentration decreases because you know you can rewatch classes later. There's no pressure to do assignments since you don't have to deal with teachers physically. ,In physical classes you have to force yourself to concentrate because you can't re-watch sessions. 
2/2/2021 1:00:21,JKUAT,,"STEM - sciences, tech, engineering, math related",Yes,"Video Conferencing tools - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc., E-learning platforms",,I prefer online learning honestly cause my concentration is better. And also I’m a terrible time keeper so it helps cause when i wake up i just log in,I prefer online learning
