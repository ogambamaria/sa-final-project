opinion,,,,,,,,
"it was way too much work. i feel like the lecturers gave us a lot more work than they would if classes were in person. also, the concepts were harder to understand because the lecturer would just drone on and on and it got really really boring. i preferred in person learning ",,,,,,,,
I can say that it's the worst learning experience ever,,,,,,,,
Not as effective,,,,,,,,
"It feels like I’m teaching myself, like the lecturer gives notes and talks for 3 hours but at the end of the day I’ll just use the notes because there’s no difference ",,,,,,,,
I think it’s only ineffective in our system because the lecturers teach like we are on campus physically instead of trying to make the classes more engaging ,,,,,,,,
Not as effective,,,,,,,,
"I'd rather study from school,its hard ti catch up during classes cause if the teachers pace and it's hard to ask questions cause I have anxiety and can't speak with 140 other students hearing me...",,,,,,,,
"- Concentration is hard due to distractions at home 
- Advantage is that we get to do open book CATs and quizzes ",,,,,,,,
It’s too tiring ,,,,,,,,
I prefer traditional methods where you go to class and attend classes from there.. I just focus better,,,,,,,,
"It has been a straining experience. Despite having the opportunity to go on with studies, it's been difficult to keep up due to several emergencies that one has to urgently attend to, distractions from the environment like network disconnections and general anxiety of the ongoing pandemic.",,,,,,,,
"Online learning is not efficient... people struggle to understand in class and you cant get proper help 
",,,,,,,,
"In comparison to traditional/Offline learning, I preferred offline learning as I was less distracted in classes. I face network struggles and constantly have to catch up on online classes as a result of struggles with online classes.
On the other hand, it has kept me on top of my assignments somehow as I tend to finish my work more on time. 
I wish that we were tested in better fashion considering this is online learning. The refusing to move forward with learning and retain traditional testing methods is a clear indicator as to why our education system is considered low as a whole, in Australia they understood that a pandemic was ongoing and instead of giving the students written tests for technical units like Engineering, they gave students tasks and graded them on those given tasks. 
Online learning has exposed our poor education system, even in ""top tier"" Universities such as Strathmore and their donkey-like stubbornness to adapt to the pandemic and make changes accordingly. ",,,,,,,,
In all honesty it sucks...too much work more than I expected. I've gotten the chance to rest though so that's a plus,,,,,,,,
it’s not effective since there is no change of environment at home. The separation of home and school was very key,,,,,,,,
"I like online learning because I dead ass don't have to wake up to go and fight with traffic before going in to a lecture, or anything like that, whilst I don't like it much where its so easy to zone out, skip school in general and just do other stuff, I like how I can do other stuff while class is on going kind of like background noise but like not tooooo zoned  out kind of thing. ",,,,,,,,
"Quite good.
I think it was a learning period for all from the lecs to us students in doing online learning. A few mistakes were made.
Though I hated the long periods of having to seat in front of the laptop for so long
 The breaks were to short to even take your eyes off the screen

I love it because of the convenience aspect.

Physical learning was better and more interactive,,,,,,,,
I think it is kind of hard to do online learning cause of the many distractions around you at home.  Although at the same time it saves a lot of time by allowing someone achieve other things away from a physical class. This is cause it saves the time of the commute to and from school.   ,,,,,,,,
"Its delivery is more effective since it’s more 1-on-1 as the lecturer is “right there”, but in return attention span diminishes",,,,,,,,
Minimal effort from the lecture as compared to physical classes,,,,,,,,
Online classes are more stressful than traditional learning. A whole semester can go by and you have no idea what you’ve been learning. Connection issues don’t help anything and there is little course material given. Exams were harder because we barely understood the whole semester. It was an absolute mess altogether ,,,,,,,,
"no?
No concentration 
No understanding 
Can't discuss with classmates (it's not the same on zoom)",,,,,,,,
"It has been an entirely new experience that actually took me by surprise. In comparison to the traditional methods of teaching, I can classify it as more relaxed mode which can have both negative and positive impacts in my academic life. Positive in that I have to be more conscious and manage myself during lessons to pick up the most from the lecturers. In a normal class setup the distractions are often limited though still present. 
I can also pick a positive from the online classes whereby it gives me a chance to do a little more research and gain a greater depth in understanding. 

My only challenge will be the flexibility I have where I can miss class and still appear present by records and probably miss a lot of important details i would have picked up in a normal class setup.",,,,,,,,
"It's okay. The only issue is when it comes to math units, it is a challenge because some times it needs that one on one with the lecturer",,,,,,,,
"With online classes the ""environment"" to learn isn't being felt. You are in an environment that you mind subconsciously interprets to be that of comfort and rest throughout the years and trying to adjust it to meet the new normal has proven difficult compared to the traditional method. So, no knowledge gained tbh.I cormfotably speak for half on my fellow classmates ??",,,,,,,,
Well it promotes laziness on my side but I feel like it is a more relaxed way to learn and you can do other things as you are not in school! I've seen my friends starting businesses and juggling school. I love this way of learning despite having to learn self control when studying and  attending classes but I've seen more growth in myself and my friends dying this online learning period.,,,,,,,,
I don't see much of a difference in both modes of teaching but I have had trouble concentrating in online classes as opposed to physical classes,,,,,,,,
"It's less effective, far less effective if I may add on, because there isn't that interaction, student-teacher interaction, and the delivery on the various platforms is poor really as compared to the traditional way of it",,,,,,,,
Online classes are difficult compared to physical classes...the workload is more and paying attention is quite difficult especially when you're at home. Acquiring knowledge?? Ok for some units the lecs are very nice so i understand as soon as I'm taught...some lectures may be a bit boring (especially mathematics classes)some lecs are slow or teach for long hrs without giving breaks...so i have to teach myself some of the concepts or rather watch the recordings. ,,,,,,,,
"It is actually more effective,  more efficient in terms of how lecturers deliver material, this is holding challenges such as network availability and power outages. ",,,,,,,,
Concentration decreases because you know you can rewatch classes later. There's no pressure to do assignments since you don't have to deal with teachers physically. ,,,,,,,,
