Hate it. Lecturers aren’t equipped for such teaching
"I love it! I can be able to have my classes anywhere! 
For me, getting to my school was terrible. I live in Kileleshwa And my school is all the way in Juja. It would take me at most an hour to get there... and going back home was way worse.
With online classes I’m saving a lot of time, so I can work and still have my classes. 

Although, I’d love to access the library in my school for research purposes. But the good thing is that almost every book in that library can be accessed online. 

Online classes are everything! 

Also, I’m not trying to catch COVID-19. "
It is very ineffective especially when doing math units which require special attention
It is not efficient
"It's shitty,that's traditional methods seem to be better but that should be that way,our systems are just lagging."
I prefer online learning honestly cause my concentration is better. And also I’m a terrible time keeper so it helps cause when i wake up i just log in,
It's not that much effective compared to face to face learning.
It's harder to concentrate compared to physical classes but is convenient for general life
"It makes more sense to do exams online where you can refer because that's how our courses will be applied in real life. However, it's pretty hard focusing on learning when its online"
"It has been quite difficult,  teachers aren't as thorough as they used to be and we are given loads of assignments and in our school the teacher works with his own timing instead of the one that is given I.e cats on Sunday "
It wasn't as effective due to communication setbacks brought about by technology and also there is less interaction hence learning isn't as effective
It’s pretty good in line with the free time
"To be honest, the school has done really well with teaching daily online classes. 
Some lecturers are just unable to use technology. "
"I don't think it's very efficient considering many students experience network issues and some lecturers aren't well versed with the systems put in place.
It's a challenge as compared to face to face learning and I believe that as soon as it's safe to resume the latter schools should do so."
I found it sort of convenient in respect to like attendance and also how the classes can be recorded for review later but I find that it is much easier to skip classes and still get marked present and very easy to cheat on cats and exams which defeats the whole purpose of assessment. Overall I feel you need very high self control to consistently keep up with classes and also be privileged enough to access to things like computers and the good internet.
"Challenges, internet connectivity and prolonged hours of sitting without a break. Work load is more intense, shorter deadlines.
Benefits. Listening to recorded classes for reference.
Has it been effective not as much. Probably taught myself 80% of the units."
They didn't care that people come from different backgrounds and that not everyone might afford a laptop or phone .They never catered for bundles to be online. its a public university not everyone had amenities to facility online learning.
Scam. Don't endorse it
Its quite effective for people with internet connectivity but a huge disadvantage to those without.We are in the fourth week of learning but there are some people who have never attended classes almost half of the expected population
Online Learning is trash. I don't like it and I'd rather go to school physically.
Really prefer the traditional methods to online classes. My concentration on online classes is really very limited
I think it's better than traditional in acquisition of knowledge. However it's faced by many difficulties and the attitude of students to try it out since it's a new concept to most of the students
on a scale of 1-10 its -1,
Online learning is worse than the traditional methods of learning since interaction with the lecturer and the students is minimal. Practical sessions are hard since you cannot actively engage in them.
"it was way too much work. i feel like the lecturers gave us a lot more work than they would if classes were in person. also, the concepts were harder to understand because the lecturer would just drone on and on and it got really really boring. i preferred in person learning "
I can say that it's the worst learning experience ever
Not as effective
"It feels like I’m teaching myself, like the lecturer gives notes and talks for 3 hours but at the end of the day I’ll just use the notes because there’s no difference ",
I think it’s only ineffective in our system because the lecturers teach like we are on campus physically instead of trying to make the classes more engaging ,
Not as effective,
"I'd rather study from school,its hard ti catch up during classes cause if the teachers pace and it's hard to ask questions cause I have anxiety and can't speak with 140 other students hearing me..."
"- Concentration is hard due to distractions at home 
- Advantage is that we get to do open book CATs and quizzes "
It’s too tiring
I prefer traditional methods where you go to class and attend classes from there.. I just focus better
"It has been a straining experience. Despite having the opportunity to go on with studies, it's been difficult to keep up due to several emergencies that one has to urgently attend to, distractions from the environment like network disconnections and general anxiety of the ongoing pandemic."
"Online learning is not efficient... people struggle to understand in class and you cant get proper help 
"
"In comparison to traditional/Offline learning, I preferred offline learning as I was less distracted in classes. I face network struggles and constantly have to catch up on online classes as a result of struggles with online classes.
On the other hand, it has kept me on top of my assignments somehow as I tend to finish my work more on time. 
I wish that we were tested in better fashion considering this is online learning. The refusing to move forward with learning and retain traditional testing methods is a clear indicator as to why our education system is considered low as a whole, in Australia they understood that a pandemic was ongoing and instead of giving the students written tests for technical units like Engineering, they gave students tasks and graded them on those given tasks. 
Online learning has exposed our poor education system, even in ""top tier"" Universities such as Strathmore and their donkey-like stubbornness to adapt to the pandemic and make changes accordingly. "
In all honesty it sucks...too much work more than I expected. I've gotten the chance to rest though so that's a plus
it’s not effective since there is no change of environment at home. The separation of home and school was very key
"I like online learning because I dead ass don't have to wake up to go and fight with traffic before going in to a lecture, or anything like that, whilst I don't like it much where its so easy to zone out, skip school in general and just do other stuff, I like how I can do other stuff while class is on going kind of like background noise but like not tooooo zoned  out kind of thing. ",,,,,,,,
"Quite good.
I think it was a learning period for all from the lecs to us students in doing online learning. A few mistakes were made.
Though I hated the long periods of having to seat in front of the laptop for so long
 The breaks were to short to even take your eyes off the screen

I love it because of the convenience aspect.

Physical learning was better and more interactive
I think it is kind of hard to do online learning cause of the many distractions around you at home.  Although at the same time it saves a lot of time by allowing someone achieve other things away from a physical class. This is cause it saves the time of the commute to and from school.
"Its delivery is more effective since it’s more 1-on-1 as the lecturer is “right there”, but in return attention span diminishes"
Minimal effort from the lecture as compared to physical classes
Online classes are more stressful than traditional learning. A whole semester can go by and you have no idea what you’ve been learning. Connection issues don’t help anything and there is little course material given. Exams were harder because we barely understood the whole semester. It was an absolute mess altogether
"no?
No concentration 
No understanding 
Can't discuss with classmates (it's not the same on zoom)"
"It has been an entirely new experience that actually took me by surprise. In comparison to the traditional methods of teaching, I can classify it as more relaxed mode which can have both negative and positive impacts in my academic life. Positive in that I have to be more conscious and manage myself during lessons to pick up the most from the lecturers. In a normal class setup the distractions are often limited though still present. 
I can also pick a positive from the online classes whereby it gives me a chance to do a little more research and gain a greater depth in understanding. 

My only challenge will be the flexibility I have where I can miss class and still appear present by records and probably miss a lot of important details i would have picked up in a normal class setup."
"It's okay. The only issue is when it comes to math units, it is a challenge because some times it needs that one on one with the lecturer"
"With online classes the ""environment"" to learn isn't being felt. You are in an environment that you mind subconsciously interprets to be that of comfort and rest throughout the years and trying to adjust it to meet the new normal has proven difficult compared to the traditional method. So, no knowledge gained tbh.I cormfotably speak for half on my fellow classmates ??"
Well it promotes laziness on my side but I feel like it is a more relaxed way to learn and you can do other things as you are not in school! I've seen my friends starting businesses and juggling school. I love this way of learning despite having to learn self control when studying and  attending classes but I've seen more growth in myself and my friends dying this online learning period.
I don't see much of a difference in both modes of teaching but I have had trouble concentrating in online classes as opposed to physical classes,
"It's less effective, far less effective if I may add on, because there isn't that interaction, student-teacher interaction, and the delivery on the various platforms is poor really as compared to the traditional way of it"
Online classes are difficult compared to physical classes...the workload is more and paying attention is quite difficult especially when you're at home. Acquiring knowledge?? Ok for some units the lecs are very nice so i understand as soon as I'm taught...some lectures may be a bit boring (especially mathematics classes)some lecs are slow or teach for long hrs without giving breaks...so i have to teach myself some of the concepts or rather watch the recordings.
"It is actually more effective,  more efficient in terms of how lecturers deliver material, this is holding challenges such as network availability and power outages. "
Concentration decreases because you know you can rewatch classes later. There's no pressure to do assignments since you don't have to deal with teachers physically.
"It isn't as effective as traditional learning and a lot of things I'm supposed to learn are better off done in practice . The benefits of this is that I don't have to get ready for school and I can always watch any missed lectures that I didn't attend. Challenges of course outweigh the benefits... Internet connection of involved parties is sometimes awful, so much time is spent preparing for the class, the huge number of students in the zoom doesn't permit adequate questioning of the particular topic and it just doesn't feel like learning to me!"
"It's convenient because you don't have to physically go anywhere to learn but with extreme distractions,, lol it's basically background noise"
Online learning is barely effective as students are deprived of the very vital interaction between each other that enhances learning
"Tbh, trash trash. In class, you are able to place your full attention unlike from home. It does not also consider 3 part influences on my ability to attend the class. If there is no electricity, there is probably no internet and accessing that class will be a nightmare. In class, lecturer is able to give a question and ask you to solve it, then it becomes an easy way to query where you didn't understand from classmates or the lecturer. Discussions are also difficult with online schooling."
"It's definitely harder. Paying attention is more difficult, the assignments are heavier and quite time consuming, and staring at screens all day causes headaches. However, even with traditional methods of teaching it was still tiring but in a different way. The challenges were poor internet connection and power outages which would render some unable to attend classes. The benefits include learning from home so you're comfortable and you don't have to think about commuting. In terms of acquiring knowledge I feel like there's no difference. We still have to read a lot on our own. "
easy to get distracted and the classes are shorter. acquiring knowledge is the same.
"Less effective
Poor connection 
Power outage
Bundles cost"
"First of all, there's too much work, they don't take into consideration that we're in the middle of a whole pandemic. Second, University of Nairobi is quite unfair especially considering its vast majority consists of people who can not access online classes yet they still choose to push for it and exclude very many people."
"It's stressful and expensive, however, it has proved to be necessary during these trying times"
It's been really hectic especially studying chemistry online with little to no visual aids and no experiments. The work load is thrice the normal workload when we are in school physically. Lectures seem to really rash through topics and it's really anxiety fuelling to ask questions in a meeting if you didn't understand. My experience hasn't been great but the only thing i love about online learning is that  the flexibility of hours and that I can attend without thinking about my physical appearance
"It's really exhausting to have to look at a screen from 8-5
The teachers try to provide learning materials 
Communication barrier is the biggest issue because sometimes we have a week long blackout and the network isn't as good so you miss a week's worth of class 
Or the lec does not know how to use the platform so he or she is just unclear all through
Mathematics classes are the worst because you literally don't understand and the lec just moves on without you "
It is not as efficient as physical classes as sometimes I just decide to sleep.
"Has it benefits as well as its losses, but losses are much more.
I prefer traditional methods of teaching as there is more teacher student contact time.
Aquisition of knowledge is not at the level one would like to be at."
"Online learning has honestly been difficult. Not only due to the change of environment, but also the ignorance of some lectures to the facts. Teaching is rushed, and it is difficult to follow concepts when you don’t have enough time to internalise what is happening. I could go on, but to summarise, it is hard "
"It's like when you're watching a video on YouTube, then get distracted by another tab. It lacks the human touch of a classroom, both in the lecturer/student and student/students (with classmates or schoolmates)relationships...group work, has to be done online too. 
Living in a noisy neighbourhood, is crazy, for home study and also while attending the classes.
It is flexible, alright, in the sense that you don't even have to actively participate(most of the time the audio and video broadcasting from the students' devices is disabled), and in the event that one misses a session, they can get a recorded version of it. Saves on time too, that would have otherwise been lost trying to manoeuvre through traffic, if one doesn't reside within the school.
"
It is poor on our end. Using google meet that only accommodates 100 students yet my class has 180 peopl- royal rumble every day. There's the problem of a online poor library even the lexis nexis subscription the school didn't renew. I honestly believe no professional body should endorse these degrees. Then the jokers at CLE decided no other online exam should be offered but the online classes should continue as they are. Smh! Is evaluation better than learning the course?
"It has been not been as good as it is put out to be in public. Starting from the quality of connection on the lecturer's side to the complete inconsistency of hosting of classes as per the timetables. In terms of the extent to which we, as students, grasp information that is being taught, I would say we are able to retain close to nothing from it. Perhaps, it might be my school alone in the entire university, but the experience of online learning was horrible for me. "
"Harder to understand whatever is being taught, Internet problems, participants limits on conferencing apps. Would rather study traditionally in school"
My academic life has definitely taken a hit. My attention span for classes seems shorter than when I was attending face to face classes
"Lecturers insist on using  video conferencing platforms that cannot accommodate large number of students.... it also takes them awhile to figure how the platforms work 
Some refuse to share learning materials or record classes 
It's just frustrating. The only convenience is that I'm learning from my bed . It's not very effective because quite a number of students aren't able to access classes because of lack of wifi, bundles, smart phones etc . With face to face learning at least everyone is able to come to class and learn "
"It's easier to asks questions online, it's harder to concentrate online, ultimately traditional learning is better in my opinion "
It was not very effective. Lecturers were having a hard time adjusting to the technology. It is discriminatory towards students who are unable to access the Internet. It is also biased against those who come from backgrounds which are unsuitable to learning.
"It is a remarkably inferior quality of education as compared to face in face learning and yet fees seem to not reflect that at all. Not to mention that it is more or less inaccessible to people living in far off places. During face to face learning one could seek clarification from the lecturer or with peers at convenience which made learning to be, dare I say, an enjoyable experience. This is not the case now. "
Online learning is not as effective as face to face learning. Unreliable electricity and difficulties in accessing electronics that support online learning are just afew of the issues experienced.
Highly not recommended.
I would very much prefer going to school physically at least there i can concentrate unline online where I'm literally in bed during class
It has its share of advantages and disadvantages but it has a better advantage over traditional
"I personally enjoy online learning for the most part. However, there are more distractions than in a physical class and it's a bit difficult to concentrate. "
"If is not effective at all in acquiring knowledge especially a science based course being very practical. The workload is also ridiculous because apparently because were home we have nothing to do?? It’s been challenging physically, mentally and emotionally and at the end of the semester I have honestly not gained any content from my online classes "
"Some people are doing really well in this online thing but personally it is just not motivating and even though I hated school, face to face got me working. "
More convenient but less effective and not very equal playing field for the disadvantaged
